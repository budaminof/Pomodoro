## Pomodoro app

To install:
  * `` npm install ``
  * `` npm install -g cordova ionic ``
  * `` ionic platform add ios ``
  * `` ionic build ios ``
  * `` ionic emulate ios ``
  * `` ionic upload  `` // to see on ionic, you might have to do `` ionic login `` first.

There is a demo on my [site](https://budaminof.com).

When I got into Galvanize I found myself working for hours on a problems,  I wouldn't take breaks or leave my chair.
Jeff suggested I will look in the pomodoro- technique to try and have better time management.  
And so I can up with the idea to build an app that will force me to stop and leave my chair my it is time for a break.

Pomodoro app is build with Ionic for ios, AngularJS and Express backend.
I used the Accelerometer to get movement of the phone and used vectors to calculate a step.
